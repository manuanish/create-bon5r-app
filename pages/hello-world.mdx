In this blog post, we will look at a few features that Bon5R has to offer. Some of
these features are not included in Next.js and vanilla MDX, and have been added using
remark[^1] and rehype[^2] plugins for markdown.
<br />

### Syntax Highlighting

The code below is written with Python and is syntax highlighted using the remark plugin remark-prism[^3].
The theme used is One Dark (based on Atom's One Dark Syntax). The CSS for the code is from the repository prism-themes[^4].

```py
def collatz(n):
  if n %% 2 == 0:
    return n / 2
  else:
    return 3 * n + 1
```

<br />

### Github Flavored Markdown

This project also features Github Flavored Markdown, which allows extended syntax of markdown while writing
e.g tables, footnotes, tasklists etc. Here is a small demo of the use of Github Flavored Markdown:

<br/>

##### Autolink literals

www.example.com, https://example.com, and contact@example.com.

##### Footnote

A note[^5]

##### Strikethrough

~one~ or ~~two~~ tildes.

##### Table

| a   | b   |   c |  d  |
| --- | :-- | --: | :-: |

##### Tasklist

- [ ] to do
- [x] done


<br />
This uses the remark plugin, remark-gfm[^6] to achieve the above. To learn more about
Github Flavored Markdown, visit the [documentation](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
hosted on Github.
<br />

### LaTeX Support

We can render inline math, for example $\zeta(1) = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \cdots$. We can also render
display math like so:

$$
\zeta(s) = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s}
$$

For rendering inline math, we can use the following:

```md
$\zeta(1) = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \cdots$
```

<br />
and for display math:

```md
$$
\zeta(s) = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n ^ s}
$$
```
<br />
### Markdown CSS The project uses Github's CSS to render the markdown, which is light
and portable. The recreaction of the CSS is found at the repository is found at github-markdown-css[^7].
